Executive Summary

In this course project for Regression Models, we will analyze the mtcars dataset to derive the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). Our objective is to answer the following questions:
-Is an automatic or manual transmission better for miles per gallon (MPG)?
-How different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?
Following are the key takeaways from our analysis:
1.	There is a signficant difference between the mean MPG for automatic and manual transmission cars - manual transmissions achieve a higher value of MPG compared to automatic transmission. 
2.	This increase is approximately 1.8 MPG when switching from an automatic transmission to a manual one, with all else held constant.
